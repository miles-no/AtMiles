@miles
=======

@miles' purpose in this world is to be a playground to learn and/or try out new technologies and techniques. 

@miles has a small set og use-cases around managing employees in a company. First and foremost as a contact-list. Available at web, IPhone and Android.
More features and platforms might sudden appear.

Disclaimer:
Some of the stuff you will see here is WAY over the top. Some call it architecural goldplating, or "stealing from the business".
However, this project gets it's commits from consultants between clients, or from spare time. So no business to steal from.
We allow ourself to to "all-out" on ideas, to learn and master techniques, to later be used in bigger projects.
